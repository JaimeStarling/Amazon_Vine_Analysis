# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

This project involved analyzing [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) reviews written by members of the paid [Amazon Vine program](https://www.amazon.com/vine/about). The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows suppliers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. Of fifty datasets, we went with video games to avoid conflict of interest (Jaime Starling sells multiple products to Amazon, but not video games). From there we extracted, transformed, and loaded the data for analysis, to see if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members. 

## The Data

The video game review dataset comes from Amazon's [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) is quite large and can be opened [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Video_Games_v1_00.tsv.gz) but not necessary as this dataset was extracted and transformed .
